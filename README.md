# JQuery_Cat_Ninja_Swap
playing around with jQuery to add html attributes, which in this case, is image source
# two images, one of a cartoon ninja and the other of a cat, were partitioned into separate photos
#jQuery was used to add a new attribute to allow clicking to alternate between the two corresponding portions of each picture
